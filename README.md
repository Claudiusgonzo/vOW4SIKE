## Parallel collision search for the cryptanalysis of SIKE

The vOW4SIKE project provides C code that implements the parallel collision search algorithm by van Oorschot and Wiener (vOW) [1]. The algorithm can be instantiated for generic collision finding and for solving the supersingular isogeny problem in the context of the Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation protocol SIKE [2]. The goal of the project is to concretely assess the classical security of SIKE parameter sets. The code was used for the experiments to obtain the results described in more detail in the research paper [3].

The code was developed by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) for experimentation purposes.
