# Instructions to generate data presented in [6] from raw output

The `/cpp/data/raw_data` directory contains the output of the experiments run during write-up of the paper. Some settings and code changes happened since the original experiments, and the experiment seeds do not result in the exact same raw files. Furthermore, the experiments being parallel further affects exact reproducibility. Yet, running the commands in [/cpp/data/EXPERIMENTS.md](/cpp/data/EXPERIMENTS.md) does result in the same observed behaviour.

For instructions on how to extract tables from the `raw_data`, see [/data/PAPER.md](/data/PAPER.md).
